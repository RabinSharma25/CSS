<!-- If, for example a div has a margin of 56px and another div below it has a margin of 40px, then we will thing the total gap between the two divs will be 56px + 40px, but it doesnt happen like that, in such case the margin is taken form the div whith the greater value in this case 56px..And this concept is called margin collapse  -->
